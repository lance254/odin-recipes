    <h2>About Mandazi...</h2>
    <p>Mandazis are amazingly soft, triangle-shaped donuts famous in East Africa, where I am from. They are excellent with a cup of tea or coffee. The dash of cardamom adds an authentic taste, making them different from regular donuts.</p>
    <p>You can serve them with honey or jam. Mandazis can also be served with curry, which is how we like them.</p>

    <h3>Steps on making your beautiful mandazi</h3>
    <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
        <li>
            <h4>Step 1</h4>
            <p>Combine milk, 1/4 cup vegetable oil, sugar, egg, instant yeast, salt, and cardamom in a large bowl. Mix in flour, 1 cup at a time, until dough comes together and is easily handled. Knead dough on a flat work surface until no longer sticky. Return dough to the bowl; cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled in size, about 1 hour. </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Step 2</h4>
            <p>Press dough down gently. Knead briefly, then divide dough into 4 equal portions. Roll each portion into a ball; keep covered with a cloth to prevent dough from drying.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Step 3</h4>
            <p>Roll 1 dough ball into a 1/3-inch-thick circle on a floured work surface. Cut into 4 triangles using a pizza cutter; cover with a cloth. Repeat with remaining dough balls.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Step 4</h4>
            <p>Heat 2-inches oil in a deep fryer or large saucepan over medium heat.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Step 5</h4>
            <p>Working in batches, fry dough in hot oil until puffed, 1 to 2 minutes. Flip dough and continue frying until golden brown, 1 to 2 minutes more. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate to drain.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>
